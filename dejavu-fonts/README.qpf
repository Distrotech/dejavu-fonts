Information about QPF version of DejaVu 1.5
(by Vasek Stodulka)

QPF fonts are used in QT/Embedded environments - Opie and Qtopia and maybe
in other QT-based systems. These environments are run mostly on pocket
devices such as Linux iPaq or Sharp Zaurus.

Opie contains only original Bitstream Vera font without unicode capitals.
This is the reason why I converted DejaVu fonts with all included unicode
symbols. See the NEWS and status.txt files for a list of supported
languages / glyphs.

QPF fonts are bitmap fonts; that means they are not scalable. They are
"rendered" from TTF in fixed dimensions specified in "rendering"
process. This package contains all DejaVu fonts in dimensions 8, 10, 12,
14, 18 and 24 in regular, bold, italic and bold-italic layout (where
available.)

Devices running Opie/Qtopia are able to rotate display in four ways -
portrait, landscape, upside down and landscape upside down. For each
rotation you need a separate set of fonts. This package contains fonts for
all these rotations.

Semantics of file naming is quite easy. Example: "dejavusans_100_80i_t5.qpf"
means that the name displayed in system will be "dejavusans", the number
"100" means that the font is 10 points big (divide the number by 10). Next
number and possibly a letter describes weight (50=regular, 80=bold,
i=italic) - in our example bold-italic. "t5" means rotation - files without
rotation are displayed portrait, "t5" files are rotated 90 degrees
clockwise, "t15" means 180 degrees and "t10" is 270 degrees. And yes, the
rotation is really little bit silly, one more time: nothing=0 degrees,
t5=90, t15=180 and t10=270. In fact it is more complicated - on iPaq 3870
0 degrees means "landscape" (the landscape with thumb of your right hand on
5-way button) and 90 degrees means "portrait" (you need fonts without "t"
and with "t5"). Other hardware platforms have different default rotation,
just try.

To install fonts on your device, simply copy selected files into
$QTDIR/lib/fonts. (This works for Opie, it may be different on other QT
environments. If unsure, try to find other .pqf files.) No changes in
"fontdir" file are necessary, in fact the file is required only for
translating TTF or type1 fonts and can be safely deleted. After copying
files optionally restart your Opie/Qtopia/whatever; is is not necessary,
but just to be sure.

Hint: To save flash space, select only the fonts/sizes/rotations you really
need. For example, you usually use only two rotations (portrait and
landscape) and some sizes of fonts.



HOWTO translate TTF font into QPF

Difficult way:
Compile makeqpf utility as described in
http://www.ossh.com/zaurus/mirrors/docs.zaurus.com/ttf_conversion.shtml
and translate fonts as described in page, but look into my "fontdir" file
how to create your own. (!!!)

Easier way:
download http://moria.ionkov.net/zaurus/makeqpf/makeqpf-arm to your device,
place TTF fonts in your font dir, create "fontdir" file (look in my one how)
and run

cd your_font_dir
~/makeqpf-arm -A
~/makeqpf-arm -A -display Transformed:Rot90
~/makeqpf-arm -A -display Transformed:Rot180
~/makeqpf-arm -A -display Transformed:Rot270

Known issues:

- opie-reader (up to version at least 1.1.6) does not display zcaron and
scaron (it displays "z" and "s" instead). But this not a bug in dejavu-qpf.
You can try Opie Text Editor, it displays all (or at least all czech :)
DejaVu symbols perfectly. Opie Text Editor is utf-8 only, get some utf-8
file with non latin-1 symbols and open it.
- the most applications in present time Opie do not even try to support
different encodings :(

Plans:
- divide the file into two files; one will contain normal sizes and the
other will contain big sizes of font
- make .ipks
