DejaVu fonts 1.1 (c)2004 Stepan Roh
-----------------------------------

DejaVu fonts are Bitstream Vera fonts (http://www.bitstream.com/) with
additional characters from Latin Extended-A set (Dcaron, dcaron, Ecaron,
ecaron, Lacute, lacute, Lcaron, lcaron, Ncaron, ncaron, Racute, racute,
Rcaron, rcaron, Tcaron, tcaron, Uring, uring). They are optimized for
display on Linux/X (which has some TrueType display problems), but that
should not affect their usability on other systems or in printing.

DejaVu fonts are based on Bitstream Vera fonts version 1.10.

Fonts are (c) Bitstream (see below). DejaVu changes are in public domain.

Fonts are published in source form as SFD files (Spline Font Database from
FontForge - http://fontforge.sf.net/) and in compiled form as TTF files
(TrueType fonts).

For more information go to http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/.
